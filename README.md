# DynSDT Implementations
*Dynamic Score-Decomposed Tries* which solve the scored prefix completion problem. The C# version is the primary version at the moment. The preliminary TypeScript version of the code was created just to match the pseudocode from the paper to help verify the correctness of the pseudocode.
