This is the TypeScript implementation of the [*Dynamic Score-Decomposed Trie*](https://validark.github.io/DynSDT/demo).
This implementation's main goal is to just be as close to the pseudocode in [the paper](https://validark.github.io/DynSDT/)
as TypeScript allows. Should be mostly straightforward.
